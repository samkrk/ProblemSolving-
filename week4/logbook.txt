PROBLEM #1
Time Travelling Cellar

Unless there are other edge cases that i'm missing, it looks like we just need to find the difference between the largest element 
in profit and the smallest element in decay, provided they aren't at the same index. 

So I will, 
    find largest element in profit at index i. 
    loop through decay, skipping i, finding the minimum at index j 
    return profit[i]-decay[j]

This worked for almost all the test cases. My issue on my first submission was that I was initialising the min variable to the first 
element of decay, and in the case where this was the minimum and the maximum was also the first element, it would be wrong. 
To fix this, i just changed the min variable to the max variable that we just found. Since the result is always positive, this 
approach should work now.
